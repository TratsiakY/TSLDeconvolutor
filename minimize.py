'''
This script contains class `TSLFit` for deconvolution and fitting TSL curves using first-order equation.
The initial peak positions are required, they can be found automatically or set manually. Primitive automatic
peak identification does not work properly, better to use the manual function. The initial curve also may be
smoothed, if required. The function for the subtraction of baseline is also available. Corresponding 
functionality provided by corresponding methods and used approaches can be found in their descriptions.
